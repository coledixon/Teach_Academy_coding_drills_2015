  <h2>Kitten</h2>

  <figcaption>With vast reserves of energy and an inquisitive nature, the kitten is a formidable foe to the more docile mitten. The kitten, while agile, is less adept at controlling fine motor skills like its elder, the cat. Often the kitten can be found wedged in places that a more logical and, <em>less impulsive</em>, creature would not have dared to venture.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>First discovered in 1457 on Isla Nublar. Named after its discoverer Sir Mittens the Cat. Made of knitted fibers, usually cotton or yarn, the mitten is skilled in, well, nothing.</figcaption> 
  <p>It is a mitten.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Through years of scientific research by some of the greatest minds at the most prestigious institutions of the modern era have yet to draw a definitive conlusion as to why these two beings have such trouble coexisting. One of the main schools of thoughts draws upon the fossil records in which kittens and mittens have been found together dating back millions of years.</p> <p>One of the most epic pieces shows the skeleton of a kitten a top, what appears to be, a pile of slaughter mittens. The DNA coding of these two species may hold a genetic key that has yet to be unlocked and supply insight into this ancient feud. </p>
